My chatbot will ask you for the class name, number, number of credits, days of the week the class is on, and what time the class starts at. If you enter in an invalid number for any of the chatbot prompts, it will re-prompt you to enter in a correct value. \n",

    "I used a DataFrame to create the schedule which was shown in class, but for my project I had to map what the user typed to be information that would be put into the chart. This was more complex than I first had anticipated and was quite difficult because I had to do a lot of research in order to find the right approach. I thought I would need many loops in order to map the data into the proper places, but then I found that I could directing define the column names and map into the key values in a dictionary. I believe this goes past material we learned in the class because it caused me to do some research on the topic and we never saw DataFrame used with dictionary keys and values. I learned more in depth all the capabilities DataFrame has. "
